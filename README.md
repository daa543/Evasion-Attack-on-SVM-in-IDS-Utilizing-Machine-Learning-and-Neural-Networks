# Evasion-Attack-on-SVM-in-IDS-Utilizing-Machine-Learning-and-Neural-Networks
This project is about building many machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
We used Evasion Attack in Support Vector Machine (SVM) and we build a Neural Network model.
There is a research paper describing all the challenges and the process of the models. It's also shown the accuracy of each model and the accuracy we got after the Evasion Attack
